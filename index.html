		<h2> Background </h2>
		<p>My name is Erin Eads. I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenville,_South_Carolina">Greenville, South Carolina</a>. I have two older siblings, an older sister and an older brother. My brother, Sean, is 26 and is a traveling physical therapist. My sister, Rebecca, is 24 and works for a marketing company. I also have two wonderful parents that still live in Greenville
		</p>

		<h2> Sports </h2>
		<p> Growing up I played soccer, basketball, and volleyball (56 words.) My true passion was volleyball, which I played year around all four years of high school. Student council was another passion of mine and I served on it all four years of high school as well
		</p>

		<h2> My Life Now </h2>
		<p> I now attend the University of Georgia and I am about to finish up my sophomore year. My major is Communication with Science and Disorder and I plan on going to Speech Therapy school for two years after college. My dream is to work as a Speech Therapist in the hospital for recovering stroke patients.
